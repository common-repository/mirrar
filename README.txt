This power-packed solution enables virtual try-on for your global audience on your website.

== Description ==
We, at mirrAR, are creating new-age shopping experiences. We have built the worldâ€™s first real-time Augmented Reality (AR) tech platform that lets shoppers virtually try-on jewellery without physically wearing it before making a purchase. This has helped jewellers sell products without even having physical inventory & creating a unique & immersive experience for their customers, both online & offline.
 
Shoppers can virtually try-on jewellery through mirrAR at your store via our in-store solution and have a contactless selection & try-on before making the final purchase. For online customers, you can enable virtual try-ons for your jewellery on their laptops/mobile phones so that they can experience virtual try-ons from the comfort of their homes.
 
mirrAR is one of the very few companies to have markerless hand tracking in an augmented reality application through which customers can try-on rings, bracelets, & watches virtually. We believe this will further bring us closer to revolutionizing jewellery shopping experience, especially in the contactless world, where virtual try-ons are becoming the new normal.
