 * Description:       We, at mirrAR, are creating new-age shopping experiences. We have built the worldâ€™s first real-time Augmented Reality (AR) tech platform that lets shoppers virtually try-on jewellery without physically wearing it before making a purchase. This has helped jewellers sell products without even having physical inventory & creating a unique & immersive experience for their customers, both online & offline.
